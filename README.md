Simple Pluto T6 (BO2) Mod Menu Base with: Infinite Scroller, Overflow Fix, and Dynamic Background Size (background resizes by amount of options in the submenu). Easy to use, read, and port to other games. 

I made this with GSC Studio, so you can compile that way, or whichever other way you know how. You can also use Plutonium T6's auto-compiler.
